Apify Integration Enhancement: Design Specification
1. Overall Architecture
The primary goal of this enhancement is to build an Apify scraper service that can be configured and initiated via API calls. This service will run Apify actors, monitor their execution, and retrieve results. The results will then be stored in a designated database.

2. Core Components and Functionality
a. API Endpoints:
- POST /scraper/run: Accepts Apify actor ID, input parameters, and callback URL. Initiates the scraper and returns a run ID.
- GET /scraper/status/{run_id}: Returns the current status of a scraper run (e.g., running, succeeded, failed).
- GET /scraper/results/{run_id}: Retrieves the results of a completed scraper run.
b. Scraper Service:
- Manages the lifecycle of Apify actor runs.
- Interacts with the Apify API to start actors and fetch results.
- Handles errors and retries.
c. Database Integration:
- Stores scraper run details (run ID, actor ID, status, results).
- Provides an interface for querying stored data.

3. Data Management
a. Input Configuration:
- API endpoints will accept JSON payloads for scraper configuration.
- Sensitive information like API keys should be managed securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management).
b. Output Storage:
- Results from Apify actors will be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON) in the database.
- Consider data retention policies and archiving strategies.

4. Error Handling and Monitoring
a. Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling for API interactions and scraper execution.
- Define clear error codes and messages.
b. Monitoring:
- Log key events and metrics (e.g., scraper runs, API calls, errors).
- Set up alerts for critical failures.

5. Security Considerations
a. Authentication and Authorization:
- Secure API endpoints with appropriate authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
- Implement authorization to control access to scraper functionalities.
b. Data Security:
- Protect sensitive data both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (encryption).

6. Testing Strategy
a. Unit Examinations:
- Examine individual components (e.g., API handlers, scraper service modules) in isolation.
- Mock external dependencies like the Apify API and database.
b. Integration Examinations:
- Examine the interaction between different components (e.g., API endpoints, scraper service, database).
- Use a test database and a dedicated Apify account for integration examinations.
c. End-to-End Examinations:
- Examine the entire workflow from API call to result storage.
- Use realistic scenarios and data.
d. Examination Coverage:
- Aim for high examination coverage for all components.
- Use descriptive examination names that clearly state what is being examined and the expected outcome.
