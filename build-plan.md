# Job Pipeline Build Plan

## Quick‑glance summary
The build starts with manual prep — getting cloud infrastructure, email‑sending prerequisites, and API keys in place — then moves into Windsurf‑powered coding of scrapers, enrichment micro‑services, and outreach workers. Containerisation and orchestration (Docker Compose + n8n) follow, before finishing with compliance checks, monitoring, and future enhancements. This order minimises blockers and keeps you legally compliant from day one.

  - [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/)
  - [Hunter](https://hunter.io/)
  - [ZeroBounce](https://www.zerobounce.net/)
  - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
- [ ] Warm a dedicated sending domain & set SPF/DKIM/DMARC to protect deliverability. (Use your ESP docs.)
- [ ] Provision a host (cloud VM or on‑prem) with at least 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM for Docker‑based services.
- [ ] Open ports 5678 (n8n), 5432 (Postgres) and configure a firewall.
- [x] Create a Git repository for version control (GitHub/GitLab).

## Phase 1 – Spin up Windsurf workspace
- [x] Install the Windsurf plugin, open Cascade (Ctrl/⌘ + L). 
- [x] Use Windsurf's MCP servers to launch local Postgres & Playwright test containers. 
- [x] Commit an empty "jobs‑pipeline" project structure to Git.

## Phase 2 – Database & schemas
- [x] Ask Cascade to generate a PostgreSQL Docker Compose service (persistent volume, strong password). 
- [x] Create jobs, email_events, unsubscribe_list tables with id primary keys and collected_at timestamp columns.
- [x] Write an idempotent migration script (sqlx or knex) and add to CI.
- [x] Add email_consent table for compliance tracking.
- [x] Add domains_cache table for Hunter.io caching.

## Phase 3 – Scraping & API ingestion
- [x] Code an HTTP client hitting SerpAPI Google Jobs endpoint for each of the 10 titles. 
- [x] Build a Playwright scraper (fallback for boards without APIs) with rotating proxies. 
- [x] Implement Apify integration with configurable actors and dynamic inputs.
- [x] Add ActorRunner class for Apify actor execution and monitoring.
- [x] Log raw responses to a raw_json column for debugging.
- [x] Implement dependency injection for all scraper services.

## Phase 4 – Contact enrichment & validation
- [x] Integrate Hunter.io Email Finder API; cache results by domain. 
- [x] Use Hunter.io API to gather additional company information where available. 
- [x] Integrate Clearbit for company data enrichment.
- [x] Pipe all candidate emails through ZeroBounce validation; reject catch‑all or invalid. 
- [x] Implement comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff.
- [x] Add domain extraction and company data processing.

## Phase 5 – Outreach worker
- [x] Design a SendGrid dynamic template with {first_name}, {company}, {role} merge fields. 
- [x] Implement rate-limiting (≤100 emails / min) and webhook handling for bounces.
- [x] Store send events in email_events table.
- [x] Add email queue processing with proper error handling.
- [x] Implement comprehensive email validation and compliance checking.

## Phase 6 – Containerisation & orchestration
- [x] Write a Dockerfile for the TypeScript worker (scrape + enrich + email).
- [x] Create docker‑compose.yml with services: worker, postgres, n8n. 
- [x] In n8n, add a Schedule Trigger (daily 08:00 ET) → Execute Command (docker run worker). 
- [x] Store all API keys in environment variables (n8n Credentials vault not available on Community Plan).
- [x] Add health checks and proper volume management.
